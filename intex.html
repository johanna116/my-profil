				I am passionate about animals, I ride horses since I was 8 years old 🐎 , I have always grown up with
				animals🐕. I have other passions including combat sports that I also practice since my childhood ⚔️, I
				am a member of the association AMMA within the school 🥊. These two completely opposite sports circles
				have instilled in me very useful values in life. I became a very patient person thanks to the contact I
				learned with horses ⏲️, determined, combative and ambitious ↗️.

			<h2>Horses and competition 🏅</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about horses since my childhood and I chose to compete to surpass myself and progress
				with my horse.

			<h2>fighting sports and boxing associations 🥊 ⚔️</h2>
			<p>
				I've grew up surrounded by boys and have always rubbed shoulders with this spirit of "battle" so I
				decided to devote myself to it in sport to learn self-control and discover a world filled with values
				essential to life. I also chose to join the AMMA boxing association in school to continue to live this
				passion at the same time as my studies.
			</p>
			<h2>qualities and values 🔜</h2>
			<p>
				these passions have taught me to be patient and persistent. That's why I've become motivated, determined
				and ambitious in everything I do.
